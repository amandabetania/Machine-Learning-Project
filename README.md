# 🤖 Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains **machine learning practice projects** created to explore and strengthen my understanding of ML concepts, workflows, and experimentation.

The focus is on learning-by-doing, starting from fundamental ideas and gradually progressing toward more structured and practical ML implementations.
